How to
------
You will need six building pieces: a corner top, middle, bottom, and a wall top, middle, and bottom.
The origin of the pieces should be on the bottom of your mesh, at the bottom center of the wall,
and the outside edge of the corners. If you are looking at the building, the corner is for the left
side. It will be mirrored for the other corners.
