Import vertex colors with on obj
--------------------------------

This is adapted from an adaption by Jan Kadeřábek to import vertex colors 
along with an obj. Jan's version worked in 2.78, this version is
adapetd to work with Blender 2.79.

To use, simply replace blender/2.79/scripts/addons/io_scene_obj
with the one here.
